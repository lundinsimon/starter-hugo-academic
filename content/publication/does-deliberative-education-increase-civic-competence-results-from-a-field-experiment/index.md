abstract: "How should education be structured to most effectively increase civic
  outcomes such as political knowledge and democratic values? We present results
  from a field experiment in which we compare the effects of deliberative
  education and traditional teacher-centered education. The study is the largest
  field experiment on deliberative education to date and involved more than
  1,200 students in 59 classrooms. We test the effects on four forms of civic
  competence: political knowledge, political interest, democratic values, and
  political discussion. In contrast to previous research, we find little
  evidence that deliberative education significantly increases civic
  competence."
